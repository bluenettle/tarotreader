next steps:

harry: shuffle animation, isLoading component
    isLoading - while info is getting fetched; min time set for x sec; put it in initialState in cardsSlice
    when you push the button, isLoading becomes true; when the animation finishes, it becomes false

alex: commit color + style changes, put the back of the cards in - done
    pull card button over the card on main page - done
     work on flip animation
    shuffle and flip animation are different classes applied consecutively


further steps down the line: 
add react router


backend prep: 
let's set it up on netlify first, then see about doing mongodb with express
alex: create an account
